  "title": "Fix spinner display corruption on Ctrl+C exit",
  "description": "When exiting a C-box chat session with Ctrl+C, the loading spinners in `cbox flow status` become corrupted and fail to display correctly. This appears to be a terminal state management issue where the Ctrl+C signal interrupts the spinner animation mid-cycle, leaving the terminal in an inconsistent state. We need to investigate how spinner cleanup is handled on interrupt signals and ensure proper terminal state restoration (cursor visibility, line buffering, etc.) when the process is forcefully terminated. The spinner library may need explicit signal handlers or graceful shutdown logic to prevent this visual corruption.\n\nExample:\n\ncbox on  main via 🐹 v1.24.4\n❯ cbox flow status\nconductor-playground-implement-phase-6 ⠋  Branch naming inconsistency with worktree creation\nprovider-adapter-abstraction   started          Add provider abstraction layer for IDE integrations\nworkflow-redesign              started          Rework flow workflow\nworkflow-setup-optional-commands ⠋  Add optional setup command and display available MCP tools in prompt\nadd-hello-workflow-test        verification     Add hello command for workflow testing\nconductor-playground-implement-phase-6 ⠙  Branch naming inconsistency with worktree creation\nprovider-adapter-abstraction   started          Add provider abstraction layer for IDE integrations\nworkflow-redesign              started          Rework flow workflow\nworkflow-setup-optional-commands ⠙  Add optional setup command and display available MCP tools in prompt\nadd-hello-workflow-test        verification     Add hello command for workflow testing\nconductor-playground-implement-phase-6 ⠹  Branch naming inconsistency with worktree creation\nprovider-adapter-abstraction   started          Add provider abstraction layer for IDE integrations\nworkflow-redesign              started          Rework flow workflow\nworkflow-setup-optional-commands ⠹  Add optional setup command and display available MCP tools in prompt\nadd-hello-workflow-test        verification     Add hello command for workflow testing\nconductor-playground-implement-phase-6 ⠸  Branch naming inconsistency with worktree creation\nprovider-adapter-abstraction   started          Add provider abstraction layer for IDE integrations\nworkflow-redesign              started          Rework flow workflow\nworkflow-setup-optional-commands ⠸  Add optional setup command and display available MCP tools in prompt\nadd-hello-workflow-test        verification     Add hello command for workflow testing\nconductor-playground-implement-phase-6 ⠼  Branch naming inconsistency with worktree creation\nprovider-adapter-abstraction   started          Add provider abstraction layer for IDE integrations\nworkflow-redesign              started          Rework flow workflow\nworkflow-setup-optional-commands ⠼  Add optional setup command and display available MCP tools in prompt\nadd-hello-workflow-test        verification     Add hello command for workflow testing\nconductor-playground-implement-phase-6 ⠴  Branch naming inconsistency with worktree creation\nprovider-adapter-abstraction   started          Add provider abstraction layer for IDE integrations\nworkflow-redesign              started          Rework flow workflow\nworkflow-setup-optional-commands ⠴  Add optional setup command and display available MCP tools in prompt\nadd-hello-workflow-test        verification     Add hello command for workflow testing\nconductor-playground-implement-phase-6 ⠦  Branch naming inconsistency with worktree creation\nprovider-adapter-abstraction   started          Add provider abstraction layer for IDE integrations\nworkflow-redesign              started          Rework flow workflow\nworkflow-setup-optional-commands ⠦  Add optional setup command and display available MCP tools in prompt\nadd-hello-workflow-test        verification     Add hello command for workflow testing\nconductor-playground-implement-phase-6 ⠧  Branch naming inconsistency with worktree creation\nprovider-adapter-abstraction   started          Add provider abstraction layer for IDE integrations\nworkflow-redesign              started          Rework flow workflow\nworkflow-setup-optional-commands merged           Add optional setup command and display available MCP tools in prompt\nadd-hello-workflow-test        verification     Add hello command for workflow testing\nconductor-playground-implement-phase-6 merged           Branch naming inconsistency with worktree creation\nprovider-adapter-abstraction   started          Add provider abstraction layer for IDE integrations\nworkflow-redesign              started          Rework flow workflow\nworkflow-setup-optional-commands merged           Add optional setup command and display available MCP tools in prompt\nadd-hello-workflow-test        verification     Add hello command for workflow testing",
